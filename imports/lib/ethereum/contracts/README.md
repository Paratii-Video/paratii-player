The .json files in this directory are the artefacts of truffle, and can be created as follows:

- get the repository https://github.com/Paratii-Video/paratii-contracts
- follow the installation instructions
- run `truffle build`
- the artefacts can be found in the `build` directory

What is used in the code is the properties
 - `abi`
 - `bytecode`

 If the contracts on the blockchain change, the json files probably will need updating.
